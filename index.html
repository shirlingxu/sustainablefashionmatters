    <h2>Why sustainable fashion is important:</h2>
    <p>Fast fashion is cheap, but at what cost? Companies like Forever21 and H&M have been taking over the fashion industry for years, contributing to mass textile waste and environmental pollution. </p>
    <p>Sustainable fashion is important, but it goes beyond the label. Purchasing garments made with durable fabrics and materials is an example of shopping sustainably, which can greatly benefit the environment. Although sustainable garments can be more expensive, they are made to last so they're worth it in the long run.</p>
    <p>Sustainable brands care about ethics. They take the processes of producing and transporting the products into account and therefore benefit the environment.</p>
